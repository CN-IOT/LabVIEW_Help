<h1>NI PXI-2501 Amplifier</h1>
<p class="Body">The NI PXI-2501 has an amplifier with a gain of 1. This amplifier can be switched in-line before the COM0 signal and the AB0 signal. The amplifier helps decrease the settling time of the FET switch. The high-impedance amplifier isolates the <a href="fets.html">FET</a> from the resistance, capacitance, and inductance in the external wiring. This isolation decreases the resistance/capacitance time constant seen by the FET, which improves settling time. When the amplifier is used, the switch module becomes directional, where CH<em>x</em> is for signal inputs and COM0 or AB0 are for signal outputs. </p>

<p class="Body">The amplifier has an offset that can be calibrated for more accurate measurements. The calibration data can be stored into and retrieved from the EEPROM on the module.</p>
<p class="Body">The NI&nbsp;PXI-2501 also has an amplifier in the CJS0+ to COM0+ signal path. This amplifier in the cold-junction sensor signal path is used to improve settling time performance. It prevents the impedance of the cold-junction sensor from increasing the settling time when switching the CJS channel. As a result, when scanning thermocouples, the settling time for the cold-junction sensor channel should be about the same as for the channels with the thermocouples.</p>
