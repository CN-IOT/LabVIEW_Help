<h1>NI PXI-2566 Relay Replacement</h1>
<p class="Body">The NI PXI-2566 uses electromechanical armature relays.</p>

<p class="Body">Refer to the following table for information about ordering replacement relays.</p>
<table class="Bordered">

<th class="Bordered">Relay Manufacturer</th>
<th class="Bordered">Part Number</th>

<p class="Body">Complete the following sets of steps to replace a failed relay.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ground yourself using a grounding strap or a ground connected to your PXI chassis.

<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly grounding yourself prevents damage to your module from electrostatic discharge.</td></tr></table></li>

<li>Locate the relay you want to replace. Refer to the following figure for relay locations.<br><br>

<td><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Older versions of this module might have adhesive plastic lead covers that you must remove. The module retains full specifications even if the covers are not reinstalled.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>Locate the assembly and serial number labels on the board with the relay you want to replace. White labels indicate the board was assembled using lead solder (Sn 63 Pb 37). Green labels indicate the board was assembled using lead-free solder (Sn 96.5 Ag 3.0 Cu 0.5). Lead-free assemblies have assembly numbers ending in L. The different label types are shown in the following figure.

<p class="Body">Before you begin, make sure you have the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature-regulated soldering iron set to 316 &#0176;C (600 &#0176;F) for lead solder rework or 371 &#0176;C (700 &#0176;F) for lead-free solder rework</li>
<li>63/37 Tin/Lead solder (flux core) for lead solder rework</li>
<li>96.5/3.0/0.5 Tin/Silver/Copper solder (flux core) for lead-free solder rework</li>
<li>Solder wick</li>
<li>Fine pick</li>
<li>Isopropyl alcohol</li>
<li>Cotton swabs</li>
</ul>

<p class="Body">If you have a surface mount rework station, replace the relay as you would any other surface mount part. Otherwise, complete the following steps to replace the relay:</p>
<ol class="List-abc">
<li>Use the soldering iron and solder wick to remove as much solder from the relay pads as possible. Do not leave the soldering iron on any lead for more than 5 seconds. <table class="Borderless">
<tr>
<td class="Icon"><img src="note.gif"></td>
<td>
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is necessary to reapply the soldering iron to the pad, allow the connection to cool completely before reapplying the soldering iron.</td></tr></table></li>
<li>Apply heat to the pads one at a time, and use the pick to gently pry the relay pins from the pads. Make sure that the solder is molten before prying.

<td class="Icon"><img src="caution.gif"></td>
<td>
<span class="Dark-Red"><strong>Caution</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using excessive force on a soldered pad can result in lifting the PCB trace and ruining the board.</span></td></tr></table></li>
<li>Remove the relay.</li>
<li>Clean the pads with isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs.</li>
<li>Place the new relay on the PCB pads and solder.</li>
<li>Remove the excess flux with isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs.<table class="Borderless">

<td><strong>Tip</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In NI-SWITCH 3.1 or later, you can use the Switch Soft Front Panel  to reset the relay count after you have replaced a failed relay. Refer to the <em>Switch Soft Front Panel Help</em> for more information.</td></tr></table>
