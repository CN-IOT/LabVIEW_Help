<td><a name="American_Wire_Gauge"></a>American Wire Gauge</td>
<td>AWG&#8212;A U.S. standard set of non-ferrous wire conductor sizes. Gauge means the diameter. Non-ferrous includes copper and also aluminum and other materials, but is most frequently applied to copper household electrical wiring and telephone wiring. Typical household wiring is AWG number 12 or 14. Telephone wire is usually 22, 24, or 26. The higher the gauge number, the smaller the diameter and the thinner the wire. Since thicker wire carries more current because it has less electrical resistance over a given length, thicker wire is better for longer distances. For this reason, where extended distance is critical, a company installing a network might prefer telephone wire with the lower-gauge, thicker wire of AWG 24 to AWG 26.<br><br>
AWG is sometimes known as Brown and Sharpe (B&amp;S) Wire Gauge.

<tr><td>scan list</td><td>A string composed of channel names and characters that define connections, disconnections, triggering, and timing of the scan.</td></tr>

<tr><td>scan rate</td><td>The number of relay cycles that can be performed in a given time frame.  Applicable when using a scan list. The scan rate specifies the frequency of the following actions (initial state - ch0 is connected to com0):
	<ul><li>Obtain trigger input, disconnect ch0 from com0, and wait for debounce.</li>

<tr><td>Seebeck coefficients</td><td>Temperature coefficients of specific metal-to-metal junctions.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Seebeck voltage</td><td>A property of dissimilar materials to develop a voltage offset across their junction, proportional to the temperature gradient across said junction, resulting in a current if there is a complete electrical path between the materials.  For switching, the Seebeck effect can become an issue when performing low level signal measurements.</td></tr>

For example, such a connection between the conductors of a transmission line. An intentional short (such as a short-circuit fault condition) rarely causes damage, but an accidental or otherwise unintentional short between transmission lines or power rails at different voltage potentials can often cause damage due to excessive current flow.</td></tr>
